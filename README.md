## R for trial & model-based cost-effectiveness analysis, 2019

## Code challenge

### Overview

This is a virtual code challenge hosted via
[GitHub](https://github.com/) for participants in the [R for trial &
model-based cost-effectiveness analysis
workshop](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/teaching/r-hta-workshop/2019/)
taking place 9 July 2019 at University College London. The intention is
to provide something for the more advanced R user to get their teeth
into in advance of the workshop itself. An award will be presented on
the day for the best submission, judged accounting for

  - Giving the right answer
  - Readability and clarity
  - Simplicity and “cleanness”

There is no single right answer to the challenges. We are not primarily
interested in the values of the solutions or indeed the problem per-se.
We are really interested in how the problme is tackled in code. That is,
how the code is structured, what data structures are used and how they
are handled. The decision of the judges is final :)

### Content

The challenge has an overarching problem which is then split into
smaller challenges. Hopefully, it’ll be good fun if not a little work.
You can also look through the alternative versions provided by others
and learn something new, about different ways of approaching and solving
problems.

Everyone who wants to can have push access to this repository, so a
little structure is require to avoid conflicts.

Each question goes into a directory called **question** followed by a
**two digit number**. Within each directory all files that you create
should be prefixed with your name or GitHub name. Consider using a
directory if you need lots of files. If you can’t make progress with a
task then try your hand at another.
