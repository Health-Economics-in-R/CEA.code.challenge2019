## Code Challenges

#### 1. Simple decision tree

Example taken from @Hazen2014.
Competing cance and AIDS risks decision tree.
Assume discrete time of single years.
An individual starts in the `Well` state.
They can transition into `Dead`, `Cancer & AIDS`, `Cancer`, `AIDS` or remain in the `Well` state.

Event probabilities are

* $\delta_0 = 1.182 \times 10^{-3}$: Die from other causes
* $\delta_c = 0.025$: Die from recurent prostate cancer
* $\delta_a = 0.080$: Die from AIDS
* $\beta_c = 0.0027$: Cancer recurs
* $\beta_a = 0.0083$: Develop AIDS

#### 2. Markov-cycle tree

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%"}

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(png))

include_graphics("figs/markov_cycle_tree.png")
```


#### 3. Discrete-time Markov model


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%"}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(heemod))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(diagram))

mat_dim <- define_transition(
  state_names = c('Well', 'Cancer', 'Cancer &\n AIDS', "AIDS"),
  a,b,c,d, 
  0,e,f,0,
  0,0,g,0,
  0,0,h,i)

plot(mat_dim)
```

##### Calculate mean QALYs

Calculate cumulative proportion of patient cycles in each state and take product with health utilities for each respectively.

Define the state utilities $R(\cdot)$:

* `Well`: 1.0
* `Cancer`: 0.60
* `AIDS`: 0.50
* `Cancer & AIDS`: 0.30
* `Dead`: 0


#### 4. One-cycle Markov-cycle tree

We can rearrange the Markov-cycle tree to closer resemble to Markov model by collapsing the branches into a single cycle and simply combining the probabilities.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="65%"}

include_graphics("figs/onecycle_markovcycletree.png")
```


#### 6. Roll back Markov-cycle tree

We can calculate the mean QALYs using the markov-cycle tree representation without calculating the cumulative proportion of time of patient cycles in each health state.
This is done by rolling back using the recursive equation ([value iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process#Value_iteration)):

$$
V_n(i) = R(i) + \sum_j p_{ij} V_{n-1}(j)
$$


#### 5. Roll back stochastic tree

So far we have only considered discrete time.
The Markov-cycle tree representation can be extended to continuous time as a _stochastic tree_.
Probabilities are now replaced by rates.
This change is represented by zigzag lines in the diagrams.
This is clearly a more compact representation.

We can calculate mean QALY in an analogous way to the discrete-time case by rolling back using the recursive equation:

$$
V(S) = \frac{R(i)}{\sum_j \lambda_j} + \sum_j p_j V(S_j)
$$

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%"}

include_graphics("figs/stochastic_tree.png")
```

* `Cancer`: $\lambda_c = 0.03250$/year
* `AIDS`: $\lambda_a = 0.10$/year
* `Dead from Cancer`: $\mu_c = 0.3081$/year
* `Dead from AIDS`: $\mu_a = 0.9970$/year
* `Dead other`: $\mu_0 = 0.014191$/year
