## R for trial & model-based cost-effectiveness analysis, 2019
## Code challenge

### Overview
This is a virtual code challenge hosted via [GitHub](https://github.com/) for participants in the [R for trial & model-based cost-effectiveness analysis workshop](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/teaching/r-hta-workshop/2019/) taking place 9 July 2019 at University College London.
The intention is to provide something for the more advanced R user to get their teeth into in advance of the workshop itself.
An award will be presented on the day for the best submission, judged accounting for

* Giving the right answer
* Readability and clarity
* Simplicity and "cleanness"

There is no single right answer to the challenges. We are not primarily interested in the values of the solutions or indeed the problem per-se.
We are really interested in how the problme is tackled in code. That is, how the code is structured, what data structures are used and how they are handled.
The decision of the judges is final :)

### Content
The challenge has an overarching problem which is then split into smaller challenges. Hopefully, it'll be good fun if not a little work.
You can also look through the alternative versions provided by others and learn something new, about different ways of approaching and solving problems.

Everyone who wants to can have push access to this repository, so a little structure is require to avoid conflicts.

Each question goes into a directory called __question__ followed by a __two digit number__.
Within each directory all files that you create should be prefixed with your name or GitHub name.
Consider using a directory if you need lots of files.
If you can't make progress with a task then try your hand at another.
